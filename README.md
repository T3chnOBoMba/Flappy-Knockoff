# Flappy-Knockoff
A "Flappy Bird"-like game I made for my phone (is still a work in progress). I'm aware that my mvc architecture probably isn't great, but I'm still learning and trying to improve on it.
I plan on making more changes and adding more features, this is just a fun personal project.
I'm currently working on creating a menu for the start/pause/game over screens, but there are still some bugs to work out. I was also hoping to implement a "stats" screen that will save data like games played, total points earned, etc.
