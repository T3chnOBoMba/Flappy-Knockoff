# Flappy-Knockoff
A "Flappy Bird"-like game I made for my phone (is still a work in progress). I'm aware that my mvc architecture isn't great, but I'm still learning.
I plan on making more changes and adding more features, this is just a fun personal project. This is just a simple flappy bird game, emphasis on simple.
